https://youmatter.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/helping-friend-campus/,Helping a Friend on Campus,"Second semester of my freshman year of college, the counseling center sent a friend of mine to the hospital. The counselor was concerned that she was suicidal and both she and my friend thought it best that she sought outside treatment. While the choice was difficult, it was in the best interest of her safety and well-being. Once I found out, all I wanted to do was help her, but I did not know exactly how. Some friends and I sought guidance through both the counseling center and student affairs and I learned quite a bit about college resources both for my friend who was struggling and for me – a member of her support system.

While she was in the hospital, I met with her case manager in student affairs, who was incredibly helpful. He provided ride vouchers so that my friends and I could visit her for free. He also offered to reach out to my professors to encourage them to relax on deadlines. Additionally, my friends and I met with a counselor at the counseling center to discuss how best to navigate her return to campus. I was lucky to have friends alongside me so that we could work together to figure it all out. Although taking care of her was a priority, I could not forget to focus on myself and my success at school.

In talking to peers, I found that while it is not uncommon to find oneself helping a friend with their mental health struggles in college, it is uncommon to automatically know what to do. When I was faced with the task of helping my friend, I was confused with what exactly my role was. I knew I was not a therapist, but I also knew I needed to be a different kind of friend. It took me a little while to discover that balance, but once I did, I could be the support system I wanted to be. So here are some tips I learned that helped me and hopefully can help you:

First and foremost, if your friend is in any immediate danger, get them help. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), campus police, or the counseling center. Do not take it upon yourself to handle a situation you are not equipped for.
Encourage your friend to seek professional help either at your college or elsewhere. Let them know that you are there for them, but remind them what your role is. You are their friend, not a licensed therapist. It might be helpful to go with your friend to student affairs or the counseling center. It may be easier for your friend to seek help knowing that you are by their side.
Establish boundaries. Let your friend know where you draw the line in terms of the type of relationship you want to have. It is possible your relationship with that person will change. It may be difficult to accept that change, but know it is okay.
Do not bear the brunt of your friend’s needs. Be a part of their support system, do not be the entire support system. If being a part of that support system is overwhelming, you may find that time off from one another is therapeutic. Mental health can be a tricky and demanding topic. Know that it is alright to take a temporary step back from one another.
Do not be afraid to get help yourself. Helping a friend can be mentally taxing. You are not wrong to need to practice self-care, whatever that looks like. I recommend talking to the counseling center or student affairs to understand what options (including academic leniencies) exist.
Encourage behaviors that aid good physical and mental health. Alcohol, partying, and drugs may be tempting, but are not the right choice in times of healing.
Find things you enjoy together that do not revolve around your friend’s current struggles. You both deserve some stress-free fun with one another. This step may also help to rectify tension in a friendship that may result from shifting dynamics.
Finally, don’t forget to love your friend unconditionally while they are going through a rough time. Know that the hard times are not the only times that you have together. Things may change and there might be challenges, but few friendships worth keeping are perfectly simple.",0,peers,student,danger,freshman,college,friendship,ride,return,choice,treatment,counseling,drugs,safety,challenges,member,interest,school,side,task,support

https://headsupguys.org/overcoming-depression-joel/,YOUR STORIES,"""FOR A LONG TIME I'D BEEN PUSHING THINGS AWAY, HIDING MY EMOTIONS, AND PRETENDING THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK BUT IT WAS GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS AFRAID THAT I'D DRIFTED TOO FAR, AND I WASN'T GOING TO COME BACK.""

About Joel Robison:

I’m a 32 year old Canadian photographer that specialises in creating conceptual storytelling portraits that allow us all a chance to see into another world. One of the projects I’m currently working on is an ongoing series called “What It Looks Like“, where I ask people who have experienced depression, anxiety or other mental illnesses what their experience looked like when they were at their low point and when things started to feel better. I then create a blog post with images that I’ve created illustrating these experiences using the visuals the person used.

JOEL’S STORY
Joel 

WHAT WAS THE MAJOR TURNING POINT IN YOUR RECOVERY FROM DEPRESSION?
I think my major turning point was being honest both with myself and with my family and friends. For a long time I’d been pushing things away, hiding my emotions, and pretending that everything was ok but it was getting to the point where I was afraid that I’d drifted too far and I wasn’t going to come back. I wrote an honest blog post just telling people where I was with my mental health and that was really the turning point, it was like deciding to go back and climb back up the mountain.

WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT REALLY HELPED?
Being honest:

Telling people how I was feeling and when someone asked, to tell them the truth. It really helped to just acknowledge things as they come.
Going outside:

Spending time outdoors, moving and getting sunlight was really helpful, it gave me something to do that was getting my mind off just the same things.
Saying no:

Learning to say no to people and to myself really helped. There were days when I just wanted to sit and not do anything and I just had to say no, I wasn’t going to waste the day.
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO OTHER GUYS FIGHTING DEPRESSION?
Reach out, I feel now more than ever we’re in a time when people are both extremely connected but also extremely isolated. There are so many platforms for people to use to connect and talk about things they are struggling with. Find a friend or family member that will just let you talk or share or spend time with you without having to say anything, those things are important, stay in contact with people.

https://kidshelpphone.ca/get-info/7-celebrities-share-their-mental-health-stories/,7 celebrities share their mental health stories,"When celebrities share their struggles with mental health, it reminds us that anyone can experience challenges.

Celebrity #1: Demi Lovato

Demi Lovato has been very open about her experience with bipolar disorder, addiction, self-injury, an eating disorder and more. Demi told People, “If you know someone or if you’re dealing with it yourself, just know that it is possible to live well. I’m living proof of that.” Remember, recovery from an eating disorder and more is possible with professional help and support from friends and family.

Celebrity #2: Alisha Boe

Alisha Boe, who plays Jessica Davis on 13 Reasons Why, has spoken about mental health and depression. “Depression is something that’s kind of followed me my whole life,” she said in a recent radio interview. Alisha found help in a good support system and being able to talk to her mom. If you’re struggling with your mental health, speaking to a safe adult can help you feel listened to and decide on next steps.

Celebrity #3: Lilly Singh

With over 12 million subscribers, Lilly Singh (a.k.a. Superwoman) is one of the most popular YouTubers in Canada. Lilly talked about her battle with severe depression in detail when she created a “Draw My Life” video in 2013. “I eventually learned to talk about my feelings, create healthy relationships and most importantly, to love myself. It became my goal to take all the pains of depression and transform those pains into lessons and tools I could use to better my life,” she said. Remember, it’s OK to feel sad from time to time, but if you’re feeling upset all of the time, it’s important to get help.

Celebrity #4: J.K. Rowling

Depression is a common illness that’s just as real as a physical condition. Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling used her experience with depression and thoughts of suicide as inspiration for her fantasy series. Speaking with Oprah Winfrey, she confirmed that the dementors in the books are a metaphor for depression and said, “Sadness is not a bad thing — to cry and to feel. Depression is that really hollowed out feeling. And it was because of my daughter that I got help.”

Celebrity #5: Lady Gaga

“Born This Way” singer Lady Gaga has written about living with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In an open letter on her foundation’s website, she said, “After five years of searching for the answers to my chronic pain and the change I have felt in my brain, I am finally well enough to tell you. There is a lot of shame attached to mental illness, but it’s important that you know that there is hope and a chance for recovery.” Are you dealing with an anxiety disorder like PTSD? If so, it’s important to know recovery is possible, especially if you have the right information on how to cope.

Celebrity #6: Zayn Malik

Singer Zayn Malik has coped with panic attacks, anxiety and disordered eating. In his book, Zayn, the former One Direction member wrote, “Anxiety is nothing to be ashamed of; it affects millions of people every day.” If you’re struggling with anxiety, Kids Help Phone’s Breathing Balloon tool can help you relax your body and mind.

Celebrity #7: Alayna Fender

Canadian YouTuber Alayna Fender has been sharing her stories about anxiety, being a member of the LGBTQ community and more since 2012. Her video, “10 Tips for a Bad Day (for actual everyday humans)” is a must-watch. If you’re experiencing anxiety and/or panic attacks, it’s important to remember that they’re both common and there are ways to cope.

From Demi Lovato to Zayn Malik, we hope these celebrity stories remind you that mental and emotional health is an important part of everyone’s well-being. It’s OK to share your feelings and get help if you need it.

https://grownandflown.com/college-student-mental-illness/,This Teen’s Story Will Change the Way You Think About Mental Illness,"Picture this: One day you wake up with a nagging headache. You’re not generally one to get headaches, so you drink some water and go on with your day. This headache, though, refuses to dissipate. Days go by, followed by weeks and, still, that tiny pebble of a pain weighs on you. You know that everyone gets a headache once in a while, so you don’t ask for help, even though you’ve tried everything you can come up with. Eventually, contrary to your efforts, your head gets heavier and heavier under the weight of this invisible, indestructible aching.

College student writes about her mental illness 
By the time you finally ask someone for some advice, they recommend you take an Advil or two, as if you haven’t already tried that. You do it anyways, hoping this time will be different. After all, if it works for them, it’s got to work for you. Bottle after bottle of ibuprofen goes down the hatch with no relief as that pebble you so resented in the beginning becomes a stone in your brain. You go back to that someone and tell them that the pain relievers haven’t done the job and they say this: “Well, headaches always have a cause, and since you’ve addressed all the possible causes, it must just be in your head. Try not to think about it. Just stop having a headache”.


This is mental illness.

[More on Depression here.]
Mental illness has always been seen as a lesser form of suffering, even an invalid one. The continuous struggle for relief, to some, is indicative in itself of there being no real cause. We all instinctually devalue the chronic sadness/anxiety/stress of another because we believe that we know what it’s like. A healthy amount of each is normal and we continue to live relatively productive lives. So why can’t they? We believe that the answer to sadness is just to smile, to anxiety is simply not to worry, and to stress is relaxation. This assumption that we all experience emotion in the same way (and therefore may use the same antidotes) is what has fed the silent killer that is the stigma against mental illness.

MY LATEST VIDEOS
I’d love to be able to say that I’ve never subscribed to the stigmatization of my own disorders. I’d love to be able to say that this stigmatization hasn’t become a part of my daily life, but it has. Beginning at the age of ten (the age during which I first started “talk therapy”), I bought in to the idea that any psychological distress can be “beaten” with sheer strength of will. I trained myself, day-in and day-out, to conceal and combat my obsessive thought patterns and panic attacks, alone.

[More on How to Deal With Anxiety here.]
Well, aside from some serious emotional vomiting onto my parents (thanks, Mom & Dad).

There’s only so long, though, that fighting a war against yourself can be enough. And I’d love to say that stigma was fighting against me, but in reality I think it was fighting with me, manipulating my moves. Stigma made me survive off aversion tactics, rather than playing offense, and that is because I was afraid of what the other side was capable of. See, that’s what stigma does. It plays off of our fear of our minds by insinuating that we have nothing to be afraid of, which makes us wonder, “then, why do I feel horrible?” and “what’s so different about me?” It makes me feel that I’m excluded from my own reality. That idea fuels avoidance, and that is what led me down the path to bed-ridden panic attacks. And then, no amount of aversion could keep them away.

[More on Mental Health here.]
No amount of “just smile” or “don’t worry” could stop the fact that even I didn’t fully believe in the validity of my illness. There’s a reason I’ve always stuck strictly to my birth control regimen, but hardly ever feel pressed to take my Zoloft/Wellbutrin, and it’s not because pregnancy is scarier than the possibility of remaining “sick in the head”. It’s because I’ve been conditioned to value one over the other, and place my priorities in the possibilities that society has deemed worthy of offensive action.


As if sex isn’t avoidable, but mental illness is. As if I need protection from pregnancy over depression and anxiety. I know, that’s some serious b.s.

In the end, since going on leave, I’ve had to fully come to terms with the fact that, in large part, my subscription to stigma is what allowed my illness to consume me. I let myself believe that, as many people told me, “it was all in my head” and therefore not real. But it is, as real as a sore muscle or diabetes.

So yes, we may all experience headaches, but we don’t all find relief in the same ways. In fact, some of us feel we never will.",0,pebble,sadness,stone,pregnancy,efforts,fact,reason,anxiety,aversion,side,head,causes,vomiting,relaxation,ways,ibuprofen,emotion,age,muscle,help
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxqek/what-is-life-like-after-attempting-suicide-979,What Is Life Like After Attempting Suicide?,"We spoke to five suicide attempt survivors about the awesome lives they went on to live.

Every year in America, 40,000 people take their own lives; suicide remains the tenth leading cause of death in this country, and the third leading cause of death for young people aged 15-24. There is nothing glamorous about suicide, and no one knows that quite so well as those who survive an attempt. As National Suicide Prevention Week comes to a close, we decided to find out what life is like after getting a second chance.

VICE called up some young men and women who have survived suicide attempts. Melanie* is a 24-year-old Masters student originally from Buffalo, who went on to find herself in the polyamory community and through work with a suicide hotline. Shenika is a 26-year-old from Cleveland who finds joy through Weird Al Yankovic. I also spoke to Sam, a 27-year old from Virginia, who credits his dog with saving his life and hopes to open a rescue farm. There's Terry, a 20-year-old former foster child who hopes to one day foster children themselves, and Sara, a 20-year-old living in Monterey Bay who found a reason to live in dance.

* Some names have been changed at the request of the interviewees.

Melanie, 24

VICE: Tell me about your history with depression.
Melanie: When I was as young as nine or ten, I remember feeling like I was in the wrong time period, the wrong place, in the wrong family, but didn't know how to get to what I wanted to be. I didn't think of suicide as an option until I was about 12 and my friend attempted. It was weirdly empowering as I realized I had the ability to take myself out. The big things that happened up until that point were I was dating a physically abusive guy at my high school, and I had completely uprooted my life. We switched schools, switched houses. I moved from an easy swim team to a really competitive one, it was just really overwhelming. That was when I was 15.

Tell me about the attempt.
It was a Sunday night and I wanted to get out of school. I talked to my mom and she was like, ""No,"" so I was like, ""Fine, fuck you."" I went and got a bunch of pills from my Dad's medicine cabinet. I ended up taking a load of them. And then I passed out an hour later. My parents came up and asked me if I wanted dinner, and I said, ""No, I took a bunch of pills."" If I hadn't said that, I don't think they would have known anything is wrong. I think I left a note buried on my computer. I really just wrote it because I thought that's what you do when you commit suicide, but I didn't have anything to say.

What happened after that?
I was hospitalized for about a week and half. I was unconscious for about three days. There was the psych eval and then you have to stay in the hospital for 72 hours after. Then about a week of therapy. I remember even though I didn't play the game anymore... of life, I also did not fit in with these kids that were in the psych ward with me. I remember thinking, ""Whoa, I have my shit together way more than these people. I need to get out of here.""

What was it like afterwards?
I think there was a lot of denial. That was until I was in college, where I would retreat back to depression and being a victim and use it as a crutch. Then I realized that I was using this as a way of getting out of a lot of adult experiences. It was keeping me from moving forward and getting the things that I really wanted. That's when I really made a conscious effort to become a complete person.

You seem to be in a really good place now. What's your favorite part about being alive?
Coming into [my poly identity] and working at Trevor both came from when I was in therapy and looking back at where I had gone astray. With the poly thing, it was like, Whoa, there's a word for all these things that I'm feeling? There are other people who want to do this too and are totally fine with it? I think that's probably been the most exciting thing. Working at Trevor, that kind of intimacy, talking to someone when they have their guard down, you can't really get that in a normal conversation. It's a kind of bond that I haven't really found anywhere else in this world.

And what are you studying?
I'm a Masters candidate studying epidemiology and biostatistics, to look at psychiatric epidemiology and how sexuality modifies that. [I'm studying] the distribution and determinants of psychiatric disorders in different sexual and gender identities.

Shenika, 26

When did you first feel suicidal?
Shenika: My entire life has been kind of eventful, so I'm realizing that it was a build-up of things... 2013 was probably my worst year thus far. I had family troubles, I had lost friends, I had found out that my daughter may have needed a major surgery, and I was discovering that the career I had spent the better part of my life preparing for was not for me. But my breaking point was early last year during a change in my relationship. After about five or six months of being heartlessly broken up with, I was at my wit's end. I no longer wanted to live this life; anything seemed better than what I was going through.

Was there an attempt?
One day [my fiancé] dropped me off after picking up my car from out of the shop, and left to go be with the woman he had decided to leave me for. I got in my car with no clue what to do. I had been leaving my daughter at her grandparents' house since she went to school around the corner from them, and I was in terrible shape during those months and didn't want her to see me like that. I just drove. I remember thinking that if I just crashed, this would all be over. So on March 6th of 2014, I drove my car up to a speed of 85 MPH in a 30 MPH zone on a street riddled with potholes. By some miracle, I didn't crash.

How did you survive?
Once I had realized what I had done and what could have happened, I drove myself to the nearest emergency room and told the staff that I felt like I might harm to myself. After hours of being hysterical and having a psychiatrist come in and talk to me, I agreed to go into a voluntary mood disorder clinic for a minimum of five days. It was during that time that I learned about depression, and was diagnosed with manic depression.

What has been your favorite accomplishment since the attempt?
Leaving school and changing my course of action for my career. The accomplishment is not giving a damn. And finally doing something that is making me happy. The most gratifying thing about being at home and starting my own business is the fact that I can get in my truck, turn my music up loud with the windows down, and creep people out with my faces and horrible singing. It's total freedom that I enjoy the most. Driving to wherever I want when I want with my music. One particular time, I drove through the projects with Weird Al blasting, and gave the person in the car next to me direct eye contact while nodding my head. They sped off shaking their heads. It's incredible what something so seemingly stupid can do for your happiness.

Sam, 27

How long ago were you going through depression?
Sam: Oh, I still go through it. It's a daily struggle. Some days I wake up and the very first thought through my head is: ""Put a bullet in your head."" I'm as used to it as I'm going to get, if that makes sense. It's not about one thing. If you took everything that stresses me out: student loans, [unemployment], past heartbreak, all this stuff. It's been going on since middle school.

When did you attempt suicide?
It was in high school. Ninth or tenth [grade], I think. I tried to hang myself in my closet.

How'd you survive?
I used my belt and the belt broke. Before it broke, I remember, because I passed out. I was trying to get it loose, I was trying to undo it. And the belt broke.

So you decided you didn't want to go through with it?
It was more like a panic response. Nothing really consciously went through my head of, ""Oh I don't want to do this anymore."" It was more, ""Oh fuck, I'm dying.""

Now, over a decade later, you're here. What about life do you most enjoy?
Well, I'm a nerd. I love video games, I love movies. Those are my form of escapism. Before it was drugs, [but] now that part of my life is done. I play with my dog. My dog is my life. My dog Harris saves my life on a daily basis. Honestly, in the last four or five years since I had him, when I've had those [suicidal] thoughts, nothing compares to, ""I couldn't do that to my dog.""

What's your ultimate dream?
To own my own farm. I want to do a rescue farm for dogs.

Terry, 20
When did you first feel suicidal?
Terry: I first felt suicidal when I was 17 years old, I did attempt to commit suicide when I was 18 on October 15th 2013, I bought three packs of paracetamol from the shops and took them all at once. It happened while I was at work, I kept throwing up, so I was rushed to hospital. I was given tablets to make me sick, I was constantly throwing up what felt like my stomach lining. I had to stay in hospital overnight and throughout the night blood tests were being taken.

What makes you the happiest to be alive?
My friends that I have around, that I know I can go to when I'm feeling low, they are able to bring my mood back up. Also, recently getting into contact with my dad and my little brothers that I hadn't even met yet, [since] I was fostered. I hadn't seem them in over nine years. My dream is to become a foster carer and look after children that I was once in the same boat as, show them love and care, so that they don't go through life not knowing what it's like to be cared about. Unfortunately, we don't have many caring foster people; most usually do it for the money. My dream is also to just be happy, and have a family of my own that will unconditionally love me. My favorite memory is spending Christmas 2013 with my partner and his parents after the suicide attempt. I hadn't had a proper Christmas for as long as I can remember!

Sara, 20

Tell me about your history with suicide.
Sara: I was a freshman in high school when I attempted to take my life. My dad was an alcoholic, and a drug abuser, who was very abusive, physically, emotionally, mentally—very abusive. So I had to live with that until I was 12, when my mom divorced him, but the damage was already done. I also had an eating disorder. My freshman year I was like 85 pounds. I just felt like there was nothing left.

When was the attempt?
I would get these breakdowns to the point where I couldn't breathe. I remember writing in my diary, but I couldn't remember what I was writing, and then I decided that I couldn't do it anymore. My brother was home. I went into the bathroom and grabbed ibuprofen. I just started taking them and then I went and sat in my room and started getting sleepy, but I was thirsty, so I went into my kitchen to grab a glass of water and that's the last thing I remember. I woke up in the hospital and my brother was sitting next to me.

What eventually made life worth living for you?
I was a dancer before [the attempt and resulting hospitalization], but not a very serious dancer. Then I came back and I went into the dance studio, and my dance teacher sat me down and said, ""I think you need to do more dance."" So I just started dancing every single day. It saved my life. Because I wasn't good at expressing my feelings verbally, but I could express how I was feeling through dance. I just started dancing, and teaching. It was mostly contemporary, but I did everything.

Is dance still a part of your life now?
Yes, right now I am the captain of my university's dance team. I just finished a year teaching dance at this place called Dance Fusion, it's for kids who can't really afford dance [classes]. So we teach them dance for free or on really low rates.

https://variety.com/2018/scene/news/lady-gaga-mental-health-struggles-1203023093/,Lady Gaga Opens Up About Her ‘Mental Health Crisis’,"Lady Gaga has no problem living — and revealing — her truth. While accepting a patron award at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation’s third annual Patron of the Artists Awards on Thursday night in Beverly Hills, the “Star Is Born” actress called on Hollywood to provide better mental health care for people in the entertainment business. In a nearly 25-minute speech, she detailed her own “mental health crisis” that prompted her to seek professional help after becoming overwhelmed by work commitments. “I began to notice that I would stare off into space and black out for seconds or minutes,” Gaga recalled. “I would see flashes of things I was tormented by, experiences that were filed away in my brain with ‘I’ll deal with you later’ for many years because my brain was protecting me, as science teaches us. These were also symptoms of disassociation and PTSD and I did not have a team that included mental health support.” She explained that her struggles “later morphed into physical chronic pain, fibromyalgia, panic attacks, acute trauma responses, and debilitating mental spirals that have included suicidal ideation and masochistic behavior.” Gaga, who has been open about being a survivor of sexual assault, suggested that SAG-AFTRA partner with her Born This Way Foundation to implement mental health programs for union members. She even said she would make an unspecified donation to launch the initiative. ￼ “I wish there had been a system in place to protect and guide me, a system in place to empower me to say no to things I felt I had to do, a system in place to empower me to stay away from toxic work environments or working with people who were of seriously questionable character,” Gaga said. “There were days that I struggled or couldn’t make it to work and I don’t want that for other artists or anyone.” She ended her remarks by declaring, “Let’s change the f—ing world!” Calling mental health issues a “crisis of epic proportions,” she said, “We need to bring mental health into the light. We need to share our stories so that global mental health no longer resides and festers in the darkness.” “It is dangerous and we know this because amongst other shootings and acts of violence — just last night there was a shooting in Thousand Oaks by a veteran who was believed to have suffered from untreated post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a mental health issue,” she added.",1,survivor,acts,artists,problem,system,things,mental,donation,behavior,patron,ideation,flashes,partner,actress,mental,darkness,sexual,struggles,f,work
https://bornthisway.foundation/personal-letter-gaga/,“Head Stuck In A Cycle I Look Off And I Stare” A Personal Letter From Gaga,"At Born This Way Foundation, we believe in telling your story – good or bad, challenging or triumphant. Deciding to speak openly can be hard, but it can also be a gateway to healing and a comfort to others who thought they were alone. There has been a tremendous response to our co-founder Lady Gaga’s brave admission that she has been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Below is an open letter she wrote sharing her story. We hope it will be an inspiration to others to do the same and to seek the help and support they need to recover. Lady Gaga Black and White I have wrestled for some time about when, how and if I should reveal my diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). After five years of searching for the answers to my chronic pain and the change I have felt in my brain, I am finally well enough to tell you. There is a lot of shame attached to mental illness, but it’s important that you know that there is hope and a chance for recovery. It is a daily effort for me, even during this album cycle, to regulate my nervous system so that I don’t panic over circumstances that to many would seem like normal life situations. Examples are leaving the house or being touched by strangers who simply want to share their enthusiasm for my music. I also struggle with triggers from the memories I carry from my feelings of past years on tour when my needs and requests for balance were being ignored. I was overworked and not taken seriously when I shared my pain and concern that something was wrong. I ultimately ended up injured on the Born This Way Ball. That moment and the memory of it has changed my life forever. The experience of performing night after night in mental and physical pain ingrained in me a trauma that I relive when I see or hear things that remind me of those days. I also experience something called dissociation which means that my mind doesn’t want to relive the pain so “I look off and I stare” in a glazed over state. As my doctors have taught me, I cannot express my feelings because my pre-frontal cortex (the part of the brain that controls logical, orderly thought) is overridden by the amygdala (which stores emotional memory) and sends me into a fight or flight response. My body is in one place and my mind in another. It’s like the panic accelerator in my mind gets stuck and I am paralyzed with fear. When this happens I can’t talk. When this happens repeatedly, it makes me have a common PTSD reaction which is that I feel depressed and unable to function like I used to. It’s harder to do my job. It’s harder to do simple things like take a shower. Everything has become harder. Additionally, when I am unable to regulate my anxiety, it can result in somatization, which is pain in the body caused by an inability to express my emotional pain in words. But I am a strong and powerful woman who is aware of the love I have around me from my team, my family and friends, my doctors and from my incredible fans who I know will never give up on me. I will never give up on my dreams of art and music. I am continuing to learn how to transcend this because I know I can. If you relate to what I am sharing, please know that you can too. Traditionally, many associate PTSD as a condition faced by brave men and women that serve countries all over the world. While this is true, I seek to raise awareness that this mental illness affects all kinds of people, including our youth. I pledge not only to help our youth not feel ashamed of their own conditions, but also to lend support to those servicemen and women who suffer from PTSD. No one’s invisible pain should go unnoticed. I am doing various modalities of psychotherapy and am on medicine prescribed by my psychiatrist. However, I believe that the most inexpensive and perhaps the best medicine in the world is words. Kind words…positive words…words that help people who feel ashamed of an invisible illness to overcome their shame and feel free. This is how I and we can begin to heal. I am starting today, because secrets keep you sick. And I don’t want to keep this secret anymore. A note from my psychologist, drnancy; If you think you might have PTSD, please seek professional help. There is so much hope for recovery. Many people think that the event that stimulated PTSD needs to be the focus. Yet often, people will experience the same event and have completely different reactions to it. It is my opinion that trauma occurs in an environment where your feelings and emotional experience are not valued, heard and understood. The specific event is not the cause of traumatic experience. This lack of a “relational home” for feelings is the true cause of traumatic experience. Finding support is key. Click here or visit the National Institute for Mental Health for more information on PTSD in all its forms and where to find help. If you are in crisis now, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8225).",1,hope,admission,inspiration,response,chance,feelings,enthusiasm,triggers,anxiety,shower,secrets,life,amygdala,psychiatrist,youth,countries,experience,circumstances,memory,mind
https://youmatter.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/suicide-prevention-month-hopehappens/,Suicide Prevention Month: #HopeHappens,"Suicide is one of the first leading causes of death in the United States. People often feel alone and isolated when going through these feelings due to shame and stigma around mental illness. This month is National Suicide Prevention Month, and oftentimes, it is difficult to reach out for help when a person is suffering from suicidal thoughts or ideation. I know this personally because I have been there, too. Starting in first grade all the way through my high school graduation, I was severely bullied. I was called names, made fun of, bullied online, and even told to kill myself multiple times. Around my sophomore year of high school, I could not take the pain any longer and attempted to end my life. After that incident, I reached out to my friend, and she helped me make an appointment with a therapist and psychiatrist. As my life went on, things improved some, however, they also went downhill when my parents divorced. That was going into my senior year of college, just under a year ago. Finally, I got serious about my mental health. I knew that if I wanted to be happy and continue living, I needed to really put myself out there and get support. I went into treatment early December 2017, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Since then, I have been in and out of treatment, having really good days as well as really bad days. I am so grateful for the support that I have received this far in my life. Mental illness is no joke, and reaching out for help can save lives. My friend who told me it might be time to seek professional help quite honestly saved my life. She was a former youth leader of mine, and while it was hard to hear that I needed to seek therapy, I ended up getting the help I needed after a great deal of denial. Showing up for your friends and loved ones is so important, and it can often be the lifeline for that person. However, it is not always an easy task to support someone in crisis. In offering support to a person who is suffering from suicidal thoughts or ideation, there are five steps that can be helpful in supporting them. They include: asking, keeping the person safe, being there, helping the person connect, and following up. Asking. If you suspect a friend or loved one is considering suicide, don’t hesitate to reach out to them. Suicide is a tough subject that isn’t talked about enough, but there is never any harm in asking. If you are hesitant about asking due to the possibility of triggering the person and causing them to become suicidal, the chances of you asking will not necessarily increase their thoughts. Through asking about suicide, it shows that you are coming from a place of non-judgmental caring, and through being straightforward with the person, it may help them feel comfortable and open up more. As I said before, asking about someone’s wellbeing, as well as just being there to listen to what they are going through, might just save their life. Keeping them safe. Once you’ve asked the person you are concerned about if they are considering suicide and they respond ‘yes,’ the next step is to help keep them safe. Any action to keep them safe is key in this step, whether it be having them stay with you for a while, going to their house to check in, or worst case scenario, taking them to a hospital are all great options. As well as looking out for this person, make sure that they do not have a way to harm themselves. It is important to do what we call a risk assessment, asking the person if they have a specific plan on how they would end their lives, if they have what they would need to complete it, and if they have a specific timeframe in mind. Again, this may seem scary, but you are doing the right thing by being there and supporting them. Being there. Being there for a friend or loved one experiencing suicidal thoughts or ideation is one of the best things that you can do. Simply telling the person that you care and are there for them will mean more to them than they can express. It may seem like they do not want support at first, but you are showing them that you truly care, and again, that can be a life-changer for that person. Whether it is physically being there for the person, talking to them over the phone until they have calmed down a little, or finding other ways to be there, as we will touch on in the next point, whatever you do is helpful. Help them connect. It is so important to help a person considering suicide connect to positive resources around them. Just like my former youth leader did for me, she suggested I seek help. While she did not live in the same state at that time, she still reached out to me through the phone and helped me find resources, even from afar, including outpatient therapy, and other formal resources. There are so many helpful resources, and they are all just an internet search away. One of the most important resources is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, that has people to talk to 24/7, and you can reach them at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Follow up. Following up to see how a friend or loved one is after expressing their thoughts of suicide is needed more than you may think. Following up shows a person that you care about them by checking back in with them. Ask them if the connections you have helped them make have been helpful, and continue to send encouraging text messages, or even call them every so often to check in on them. Checking in with a person considering suicide increases the chance of them opening up and trusting you to help support them in times of need. These five steps can help you reach out and support a person going through a difficult time. If you are the person considering suicide, I strongly encourage you to reach out. I don’t know you or what you’re going through, but I do absolutely know how you feel. It is such a terrifying place to be in, but please know that you are not alone in this. There are people who care about you, and you were put on this earth for a specific purpose that no one else can fulfill. Seeking help is a challenge, no doubt, but you are worth the time and attention.

https://www.beyondblue.org.au/who-does-it-affect/personal-stories/story/sarah,Personal stories Sarah,"I promise things will get better. Just keep pushing on, one day at a time. I have always been a worrier. I can look back on my childhood now at the age of 24, and recognise the signs of anxiety developing. My stressful ways developed into anxiety around four years ago. I wasn’t lucky enough to have kept any close friends from my schooling days, and went into a reckless phase after high school, developing friendships with people who I was better off away from. When I decided it was time to leave this phase, and all the people involved in it behind, I was left virtually friendless. I put all my physical energy into working full time (which meant having two jobs), whilst completing my full time university degree. This meant working seven days a week, and completing university assignments after finishing 12 hour shifts. You may ask why I put myself through this, well I had a lust to travel, as well as an incredible partner who I couldn’t bare seeing the world without. So I took on the financial burden of paying for him to come with me on these holidays, as he wasn’t in the position to pay for himself. When I meet people one of the first things they mention to me is the number of overseas holidays my partner and I have been on. Yes, we have been especially fortunate to travel around the world, but what most people don’t understand is that travel was my escape. It gave me something to look forward to, and something to get me through the long days of being miserable in my life. When I was on a plane and it took off, this meant I could escape the life I hated so much for a short period of time. In order to work these extreme hours I gave up every aspect of my social life and wellbeing. This meant I had a very small group of people I interacted with, none of whom were females my own age. I ate terribly and never exercised, resulting in weight gain, as I was simply too exhausted to cook or go to the gym after work. Every cent of my wage went into paying for two people to go on numerous overseas holidays, so I was never able to indulge in anything in my day to day life. This pattern kept up for well over two years, from which I developed horrific social anxiety. My experience of dealing with social anxiety is a feeling of overwhelming fear when interacting with individuals I wasn’t comfortable with. I was unable to look people in the eye when speaking to them, and struggled to keep a conversation going. I came off as both extremely quiet and shy, as well as rude, which anyone who knows me well knows I am the opposite of. During this period of my life my self-confidence was at an all-time low, and I felt disgusted every time I looked in the mirror. I stayed away from people as much as I could, and felt I made an embarrassment of myself whenever I went out in public. I constantly had a voice in my head saying “Why would anyone want to be friends with you? You are ugly and pathetic.” Things turned around when my partner finished his apprenticeship, and was lucky enough to get a well-paying job. This meant for the first time in our relationship I no longer held the financial burden. For the first time in over three years I was able to spend money on things which seem so trivial but play a huge role in our self-confidence, such as getting my hair done and buying some new clothes. I also cut back on my ridiculous work schedule. I’m happy to say now that a year on things have improved tremendously. Would I say my life is perfect and I am happy every day? No. But do I still have that feeling that I am dying on the inside? Not in the slightest. I did small things, which made such a huge change to my life. Such as joining a netball team, regularly going to the gym, and pushing myself to interact socially whenever I was given the opportunity. I still struggle in social situations, but nowhere near to the extent in which I did. Most importantly, I have a partner who has stayed by my side, through all the anxiety attacks and sleepless crying nights, whilst loving me unconditionally, when I was an extremely hard person to love. I recently started a job which I thought was going to be the beginning of my career. However, things are not always perfect and I realised this job was causing my anxiety to reappear. I was going back down the path to the dark place I had been for so long. I can say that for the first time in my life I put my mental health first and quit this job. It took me too long to crawl out of that pitch black, horrific place and I do not intend to ever return. I understand my story may be nothing compared to what some people face, but if even one person relates it was worth writing. So if you are out there, I promise things will get better. Just keep pushing on, one day at a time.",0,university,energy,public,holidays,extent,worrier,aspect,eye,feeling,nights,anxiety,partner,plane,side,shifts,head,clothes,voice,mirror,lust
https://www.beyondblue.org.au/who-does-it-affect/personal-stories/story/michael,Personal stories Michael,"Once I realised exactly what was going on with my mind, and could put a label on it, I began opening up to my friends and family about how I was feeling. As far back as I can remember, I have been a quiet, nervous kid. It’s not too hard to imagine, because I’m a pretty quiet, nervous twenty-five-year-old too. One who can be painfully shy, more than a little awkward, and who frets about things both real and imagined. I’m scared of disappointing people, of being rude, and of being disliked. The irony of it being hard to be well-liked when you’re too scared to talk to someone is not lost on me either. Whether it’s meeting people for the first time, trying something new, or being put into an uncomfortable situation - for as long as I can remember these situations make me tense up, retreat into myself, and wish for it to all be over. It first began spiralling out of control throughout those dreaded high school years. Fears of being hit by a football when I walked across the oval to class every day, or getting laughed at for saying something wrong in class, made me hyper aware of anything that could make me look like an idiot (and heaven forbid, make me stand out of the crowd). When you’re desperate to remain invisible, you begin to think that anything that could go wrong, will go wrong. It wasn’t until after leaving school, that I realised that these fears hadn’t subsided. It wasn’t just the kids at school whose opinions I feared, and who I didn’t want to look like a fool in front of, it was the wider world, a world which I was now a part of. When I was much older I was able to pin down exactly what was going on in my mind, and why these things made me feel the way I did – I had anxiety. Once I realised exactly what was going on with my mind, and could put a label on it, I began opening up to my friends and family about how I was feeling. It wasn’t a sob story, or even a plea for help, in fact, once I was able to open up about it, the first instinct was to share a laugh about it. By talking about the different situations I get anxious in, and shouting ‘riddikulous’ at them, I hoped to be able to turn them from something scary, into something I’m able to laugh about. (Shout-out to the Harry Potter fans who get this metaphor). I can acknowledge that more often than not it is utterly ridiculous the things I worry about, but the wrong mindset can trigger a molehill into a mountain. When fears are more than just funny anecdotes, they can change your way of life and limit how you engage with the world. They stop you being the real you, and make you second guess every single choice you make, and every situation you find yourself in. It can be the hardest thing to do, but standing up and saying that you deserve better than this is the first step to helping yourself. There’s no shame in admitting that you don’t want this kind of life for yourself, and that you need to talk to someone – whether a professional or a friend – to work through it. We can get weighed down in the monotony of the day-to-day, or held back by the negativity, that we can forget that we only get one shot at this life, and to reel ourselves back from living it to the full is only doing ourselves a disservice. It can seem more comfortable withdrawing from life to avoid these fears, but when we reach the end of our time, are we going to remember the peace of mind we had each time we avoided uncomfortable situations, or are we going to remember the time we met our fears head-on and had a blast as a result. With the resources and help we have available, living in these fears doesn’t have to be a reality. There’s a whole wide world out there for the taking, and we’re the only ones stopping ourselves from truly enjoying it. Feeling a little overwhelmed? Ready to shed your fears and live your real life? Let’s do this together.",0,fool,things,riddikulous,situations,shot,fears,fact,disservice,result,football,idiot,fans,peace,molehill,reality,anxiety,choice,mindset,oval,front

He didn't want to answer emails, and hundreds of answerphone messages went unreturned. Feeling as though the world was against him he didn't want to leave home. Gripped by anxiety and a fear of impending doom there was a sense everything was about to fall apart and that he was powerless to do anything about it. Nonetheless, if his world was going to collapse, it was going to collapse on his own terms. That was in late 2014, when former footballer Clarke Carlisle came very close to ending his life. ""How can I sit here in front of you and say that four years ago, I put myself in front of a 10-ton lorry, at 60 miles an hour and I didn't break a single bone in my body,"" Carlisle told CNN Sport at his home in Preston. Carlisle had intentionally stepped out in front of a lorry on a road near York, just before Christmas. After several weeks in hospital, he managed to recover from the collision — remarkably unscathed. He describes his survival as a ""miracle."" Clarke Carlisle is pictured in 2013. Clarke Carlisle is pictured in 2013. 'Britain's brainiest footballer' A former English Premier League footballer, Carlisle played for clubs including Preston, Burnley, Watford in a career spanning 17 years. The 38-year-old was once dubbed ""Britain's brainiest footballer,"" even appearing on the mentally bamboozling British game show ""Countdown"" -- he won, taking home the show's famous teapot trophy. He says the suicide attempt in 2014 was a turning point for him, but his struggle with depression has persisted and about a year ago, in September 2017, he was reported missing, only to be discovered on the streets of Liverpool. ""I was intent on taking my own life,"" says Carlisle, who shatters the idea that footballers lead cushioned and painless lives, unperturbed by the challenges that affect everyday human beings. ""I was wandering around the streets of Liverpool, wondering what's the best place for me to die."" He was looking for the most practical way to die. How would he want his wife to find him? What about the first responders? And how would his suicide impact witnesses who found him? ""I was thinking about a responsible way to die. It was that procrastination that allowed a couple of passersby to intervene,"" he said. After his return to safety, Lancashire police thanked members of the public for sharing a missing persons appeal. Former footballer, Clarke Carlisle, outside his home in Preston, Lancashire.

""Now, a year down the line, where I am in the healthiest place I have been in my life -- I would say that is the one that troubles me the most, because it was at a point when I was most aware. ""It's at a point where I knew that I suffered from depression, it's at a point where I had established my own charity to help educate others, yet still the illness was able to take me to those depths again."" Clarke was diagnosed with depression in 2010. With the help of therapy he was able to pinpoint the inception of his depression to 2001, during a period in his career where he had picked up a bad knee injury. Clarke said injuries were one of the ""triggers"" for the worsening mental health of footballers. It's a view supported by a 2015 study organized by the World Players' Union FIFPro, which found that professional footballers who had sustained three or more severe injuries during their career were two to nearly four times more likely to report mental health problems than those who had not suffered from severe injuries. Clarke Carlisle in action playing for Northampton Town in 2012. Clarke Carlisle in action playing for Northampton Town in 2012. As he looks back on his each of his suicide attempts, Carlisle says that they comprised a two-three month descent and ranged from locking himself away to being actively suicidal. Now, he puts emphasis on self-awareness and understanding himself -- managing his mental health with the love and support of his family. When you're injured, you can't play and that creates ""a feeling of worthlessness,"" says Carlisle. Other triggers for players can include transferring to another club or having to retire. ""You go from being fundamentally needed to obsolete, which in football usually happens at the age of 33 or 35,"" added Carlisle. ""There are many, many things that can contribute to a player's downward spiral in football and we need to be able to mitigate the impact."" FIFPro's 2015 research also showed that 38% of players and 35% of former players reported from suffering from symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Clarke Carlisle in action in 2009.

It's a feeling shared by another former Premier League footballer, Chris Kirkland -- a goalkeeper, who also played for Preston but is better known for keeping the ball out of the net at Wigan Athletic and before that at Liverpool. Kirkland told CNN Sport about the troubles he faced with his mental health after leaving Wigan in 2012, which he saw as the most successful period in his career. A period he didn't want to leave behind. ""It was a big, big blow for me, I was devastated. Everybody suffers from mental health. Once you start going down that road, it's very difficult to get out of it -- it sort of spirals out of control before you know it."" Kirkland thinks real progress has only been a recent development. ""It's only really been over the last two or three years things have been moving forward but before that there was nothing there. Especially when I was growing up and during a lot of my career.""

Is 2018 a year of progress? According to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), the body which represents all footballers in England and Wales, by the end of August 2018, 312 football players had reached out for mental health support. That compares with only 160 players in 2016 and 403 in 2017. Michael Bennett, the head of player welfare at the PFA, turned to a career in counseling after struggling with depression during long spells of injury as a professional footballer. ""The seed was sown then, in terms of the work I do now. Although, I don't see it as work, I see it as a calling. I played football for 20 years, it's an emotional roller coaster but what I do now far outweighs any buzz I got as being a professional footballer."" The PFA runs a 24-hour helpline for current and former players, offers a network of counselors operating to offer with emotional and mental support and is now rolling out mental health workshops to all 92 league clubs. Kirkland praised the work of the PFA and is, himself, currently involved in the creation of a mental health app, designed to offer emotional support to people across society. The work of the PFA, is being complimented by a partnership between the English Football League (EFL), which runs the three divisions outside the Premier League, and the mental health charity, Mind.
